Load the data

```{r}
## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
if(!exists("NEI")){
  NEI <- readRDS("./summarySCC_PM25.rds")
}
if(!exists("SCC")){
  SCC <- readRDS("./Source_Classification_Code.rds")
}
dir()

```

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

```{r}
aggregate<-with(NEI,tapply(Emissions,year,sum))
png("plog1.png"")
barplot(aggregate,xlab='Years',ylab=expression('PM'[2.5]*' emission'),
main=expression('Total PM'[2.5]*' emissions at various years'))
```
